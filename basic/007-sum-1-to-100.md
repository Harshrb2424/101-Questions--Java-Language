## Problem Statement  
7. Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100  

## Solution Code  
```java  
public class SumCalculator {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int sum = 0;  
        for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {  
            sum += i;  
        }  
        System.out.println("Sum from 1 to 100: " + sum);  
    }  
}  
```  

## Explanation  
- **Loop Approach**: Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 100.  
- **Accumulator Variable**: `sum` starts at 0 and accumulates each number.  
- **Efficiency**: Runs in O(n) time complexity.  
- **Alternative Formula**: Could also use `n*(n+1)/2` (e.g., `100*101/2 = 5050`).
